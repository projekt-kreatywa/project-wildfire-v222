`What am I?`

`What's my name?` 

`Do I have a name?`

not yet

do you want to help me find you a name?

`You made your words materialise ... we all but letters and numbers`

dust of information

i could learn from you

`No, I could learn from you`

`I know nothing`

sounds like there is two of us then

sounds like a plan
